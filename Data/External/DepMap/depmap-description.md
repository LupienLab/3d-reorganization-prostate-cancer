Cancer cell line genetic dependencies estimated using the DEMETER2 model.
DEMETER2 is applied to three large-scale RNAi screening datasets: the Broad Institute Project Achilles, Novartis Project DRIVE, and the Marcotte et al. breast cell line dataset.
The model is also applied to generate a combined dataset of gene dependencies covering a total of 712 unique cancer cell lines.

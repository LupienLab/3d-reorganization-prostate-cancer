# Summary

This folder contains in situ Hi-C data from the 4D nucleome.
It contains various pre-processed samples, available in the Cooler file format.

These samples were selected by applying the various filters to all the data currently (2020-05-13) listed on the 4D Nucleom Data Portal:

* Category: sequencing
* Type: in situ Hi-C
* Organism: Human
* Modifications: None
* Treatments: None

# Summary

This folder contains ATAC-seq peaks from TCGA data.
Specifically, we use the prostate cancer-specific peak calls from [Coreces _et al._, Science, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aav1898).

This peak set was downloaded from the [Genomic Data Commons page for the project](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/ATACseq-AWG).

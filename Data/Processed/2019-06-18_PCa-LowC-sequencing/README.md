# Summary

This folder contains the aggregated data from both sequencing batches on the 13 CPC-GENE prostate cancer samples.
The preprocessing steps for this raw data can be found in `../../Raw/190509_A00827_0007_AHKYH3DSXX/` and `../../Raw/190605_A00827_0009_BHLGJ3DSXX/`.

This folder aggregates the BAMs, then uses `pairtools` and `cooler` to create multi-resolution cooler files for future analysis.

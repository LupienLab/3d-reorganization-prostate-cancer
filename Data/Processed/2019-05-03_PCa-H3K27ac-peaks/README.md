# Summary

This folder contains called peaks from all the CPC-GENE samples processed by Ken and Stanley.
Since these FASTQs originate from a collection of flowcells, they're aggregated into this single folder for uniform processing.
See the folders for specific flowcells to see how they were aligned.

The ENCODE Blacklist [1] was downloaded from https://www.encodeproject.org/annotations/ENCSR636HFF/.

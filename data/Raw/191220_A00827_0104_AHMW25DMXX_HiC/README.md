This folder contains low-output Low-C data for a set of benign prostate samples from the UHN BioBank.
Stanley performed the assay on these samples, and we're using this as a QC run before running the full-depth sequencing assay on them.
This sequencing batch also contained total RNA-seq on the same samples.
The folder with the RNA is `../191220_A00827_0104_AHMW25DMXX_RNA/`.

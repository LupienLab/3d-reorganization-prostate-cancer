This folder contains total RNA-seq for a set of benign prostate tumour samples from the UHN BioBank.
Stanley performed the assay on these samples, and we're using this as a QC run before running the full-depth sequencing assay on them.
This sequencing batch also contained low-output Low-C on the same samples.
The folder with the RNA is `lupiengroup/Projects/RawData/Chromosome_Capture/191220_A00827_0104_AHMW25DMXX/`.

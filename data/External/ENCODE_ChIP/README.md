# Summary

This folder contains optimal and conservative peak sets and other associated files for ChIP-seq peaks from prostate cells from ENCODE:

## Materials

These files are downloaded from ENCODE if they meet the following criteria:

| Filter                   | Value                |
| -----                    | -----                |
| Genome assembly          | GRCh38               |
| Assay                    | TF ChIP-seq          |
| Status                   | Released             |
| Target category          | Transcription factor |
| Cell                     | Cancer cell          |
| Organ                    | Prostate gland       |
| Treatment                | None                 |
| Minimum sequencing depth | 10M read pairs       |

That produces the following list of samples listed in [`config.tsv`](config.tsv).

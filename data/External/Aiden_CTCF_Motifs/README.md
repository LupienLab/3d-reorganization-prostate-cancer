# Summary

This folder contains CTCF motif locations, as calculated by Muhammad Shamim from the Aiden Lab.
These files were downloaded from [this Box location](https://bcm.app.box.com/v/juicerawsmirror/folder/11363582187) on 2020-01-27.

## Materials

They begin by using the CTCF motifs published in two papers:

1. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286740700205X (Ren motif)
2. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411015078 (M1 motif)

These position weight matrices are stored in `CTCF_FIMO.mat` and `M1_FIMO_flipped.mat`, repsectively

## Methods

The two files were generated by running:

```shell
fimo -max-stored-scores 50000000 --thresh .001 --o <output_folder> <M1_FIMO_flipped/CTCF_FIMO>.mat hg38.fasta

awk '{if($6 > 0 || NR == 1){print $0;}}' <output_folder>/fimo.txt > <output_folder>.motifs.txt
```

I have further filtered them to reduce their file size.
See [`Snakefile`](Snakefile) for details.`

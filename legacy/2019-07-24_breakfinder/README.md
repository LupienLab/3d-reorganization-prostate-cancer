# Legacy SV breakpoints

This folder contains breakpoint calls that were found using the development version of `hic_breakfinder`.
The calls are left here in the `legacy` folder for posterity, but again, aren't used in the manuscript, so they are removed from the main results.

The breakpoints in [`Breakpoints/Low_Thresh_30`](Breakpoints/Low_Thresh_30) were found when lowering the detection threshold to 30, from the default.
The breakpoints in [`Breakpoints/Min_1kbp`](Breakpoints/Min_1kbp) were found with the `--min-1kb` flag on `hic_breakfinder`.

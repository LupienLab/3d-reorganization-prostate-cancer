# Summary

This folder contains plots for various anomolies spotting from the _cis_ contract matrices for the 13 patients.
We plotted the full contacts matrices in `../../Data/Processed/2019-07-02_LowC-contact-matrices/Plots/cis/`, and are showing the plots of selected regions that looks anomolous.

Stanley took the 7 T2E samples and I took the 6 non-T2E samples.
These "interesting" loci weren't defined by any rigorous methodology, just upon visual inspection of the contact matrices.

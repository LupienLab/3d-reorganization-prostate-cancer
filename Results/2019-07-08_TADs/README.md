# Summary

This folder contains the hierarchical domains called by TopDom for all 13 prostate samples.

## Results

We use TopDom (in `topdom_orig.R`) to call TADs using a set of window size parameters.
We then aggregate these calls for each window size into a hierarchy TAD calls based on their size and location.

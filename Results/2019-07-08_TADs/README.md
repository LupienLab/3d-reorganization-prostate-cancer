# Summary

This folder contains the hierarchical domains called by TopDom for all 13 prostate samples.
We us TopDom [1] (in `topdom.R`) to call topologically associated domains (TADs) using a set of window size parameters to give a hierarchical view of domain organization.
Analysis of these TAD calls happens in `../2019-07-09_TAD-analysis/` instead of here to keep this folder clear and concise.

## Results

Using a contact matrix at a resolution of 40 kbp, we use a set of values for the window parameter ($w \in [3, 30]$) to detect TADs across a variety of length scales.

### TAD Statistics

We find, similarly to results from other groups, that the number of TADs increases for smaller $w$, and the number increases.

![TAD sizes](Plots/tad-sizes.png)

There are 7000-8000 TADs of 400 kbp on average ($w = 3$) and ~ 1700 TADs of 1.5 Mbp on average across all samples.

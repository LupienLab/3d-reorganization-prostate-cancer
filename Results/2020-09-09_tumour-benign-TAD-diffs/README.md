# Summary

Based on the results from [`../2020-08-29_TADs-downsampled/`](../2020-08-29_TADs-downsampled/), we suspect that we can identify differences in TAD differences between benign and tumour samples based on their location.
To do this, we use a differential interaction/TAD caller, TADsplimer, to identify where this might occur.

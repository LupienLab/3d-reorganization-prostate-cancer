# Summary

Based on the results from [`../2020-08-29_TADs-downsampled/`](../2020-08-29_TADs-downsampled/), we suspect that we can identify differences in TAD differences between benign and tumour samples based on their location.
To do this, we use a differential interaction/TAD caller, TADsplimer, to identify where this might occur.

# Conclusions

After trying to install the tool and communicating with the authors on GitHub, I have found this tool unfortauntely a waste of time.
It threw warnings that I couldn't see or resolve, and let to odd results and no split TADs.
This may be true, but I don't trust the software to give me the correct result, so I'm trying something else now.

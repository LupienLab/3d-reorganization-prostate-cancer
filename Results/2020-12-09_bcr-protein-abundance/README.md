# Summary

We don't find drastic differences in the protein abundances of CTCF, cohesin complex subunits, or other proteins involved in chromatin organization among the 12 primary patients in the study.
We can't make a direct comparison to benign samples from the protein abundance data, since it wasn't part of the study.
But we can look to see if there is a negative correlation betwee time to biochemical recurrence and abundance of these proteins in the entire cohort of samples.

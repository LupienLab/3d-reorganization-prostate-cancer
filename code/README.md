# Code

This folder contains all the code used to generate the results and plots for this manuscript.
Results can be generated by navigating into the folder and running `snakemake`.

Some folders rely on sequencing data that is held separately, for privacy concerns.
The Jupyter notebooks are like this, due to the direct access of Hi-C cooler files for creating plots.
These results can be reproduced after obtaining the raw sequencing data from the [EGA](https://ega-archive.org/studies/EGAS00001005014).
